0x0B. C - malloc, free
This program aims to focus dynamic memory allocation.
The functions involved in memory allocation are:
1.malloc ();
2.calloc ();
3.realloc ();
4.free ();
In our case we will focus entirely on malloc function which allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory as well as free function which frees the memory that was initially allocated.
